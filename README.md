## Goal
Create a lost-in-space star tracker that is fast, reliable and efficient.

## Pipelines
The current design has two pipelines - image recognition and catalog mapping. The first one has to detect the stars and provide the unit vector for them, and the other one applies algorithms for catalog matchin star identification and attitude designation.

## Run
Go to src/, install the requirement.txt with pip and run the real_image_valuation.py file for the test sequence
